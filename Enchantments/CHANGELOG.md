# ENCHANTMENTS Changelog

## 2.0.0

Updated for game version 1.6.14.

### Added

* Added non-optional Jade Enchantment rebalance. The vanilla version is completely useless at 10% crit. power because it's the same amount given by Ruby Enchantment, but while the Ruby applies to every hit, the Jade only applies to critical hits.
    * Before: crit. power +10%
    * After: crit. power +50%

## 1.1.0

### Added

* Added Sunburst enchantment.
* Added French translations by [CaranudLapin](https://github.com/CaranudLapin).
* Added FakeFarmer.

### Changed

* Wabbajack cheese conversion now creates individual cheese items instead of a single stack of cheese. I think it's funnnier this way.
* Tweaked some of the odds of different Wabbajack effects.

### Fixed

* Prevent showing gemstone forges in Scythe tooltips.
* Fixed GMCM menu not loading.
