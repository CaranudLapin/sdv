# Immersive Taxes Change Log

## 2.2.0 (Unreleased)

### Added

* Added the option to deduct business expenses from taxable income. Business expenses can include building constructions, tool-related costs, animal-related costs and seed purchases. You may also specify individual objects by name that should be tax-deductible.
* Added new console commands for directly setting season income and outstanding debt.

### Changed

* Tax brackets now work progressively, as in real life; i.e., instead of applying only the highest applicable bracket, income is actually split into each applicable bracket. The result is less taxes paid overall.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue where debited amount would not actually reduce the player's money when they didn't have any before sleeping. The debit now happens when the day starts, *after* the previous day's earnings have been added to the player's balance.
* Fixed a typo in introduction letter (english).
