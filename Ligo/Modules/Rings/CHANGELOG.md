# Ligo Rings Change Log

## 0.9.0 (Unreleased)

### Added

* Added the Infinity Band. The Iridium Band must now be converted to Infinity before accepting gemstones.
* Weapon and Slingshots can now resonate with Infinity Bands if the Arsenal module is enabled.
* Added compatibility with [Wear More Rings](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3214).
* Added compatibility with [Vanilla Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10852).

### Changed

* Complete overhaul of the Resonance feature, now inspired by real Music Theory. This is now a major gameplay mechanic instead of a small flavor feature, and will hopefully add versatility to the new Infinity Band and encourage variability. See the [module description](README.md) for details.
