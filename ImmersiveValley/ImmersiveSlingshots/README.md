## Features

This mod brings the following immersive changes to vanilla slingshots:

- Allows slingshots to crit like melee weapons.
- Allows slingshots to be enchanted and forged.
    - All weapon forges can applied to slingshots, but only select enchantments.
    - Brand new slingshots enchantments:
        - Gatling
        - Spreading
        - Quincy
- Adds a new special move for slingshots in the form of a stunning melee smash.
- Removes slingshot grace period, which in vanilla causes slingshot projectiles to ignore targets that get too close. This essentially made slingshots unreliable as a main weapon. Well, no more!
- (For fun) firing an empty slingshot when standing on a snowy tile will shoot a snowball.

All features can toggled on or off.

## Compatibility

Not compatible with other slingshot mods.

Compatible with Stardew Valley Expanded.

Should be fully compatible with multiplayer. Not compatible with Android.

## Installation

Install like any other mod, by extracting the content of the downloaded zip file to your mods folder and starting the game via SMAPI.

To update, first delete the old version and then install the new one. You can optionally keep your configs.json in case you have personalized settings.

Before uninstalling *you must first remove any mod enchantments from all existing slingshots, or your save file will become unusable*.
Then, delete the mod from your mods folder.
