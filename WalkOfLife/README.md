Ever wondered why there aren't any profession overhaul mods on the Nexus? Me too.


![](https://i.imgur.com/czsRulo.png)



- Rebalanced and reworked [almost] every profession to be an equally unique and attractive choice.
- Each profession targets a specific style of gameplay, some which were not viable in vanilla (i.e. ranching).
- No more ~~boring~~ uninspiring flat value bonuses.
- Bomberman mining; Assassin, Sniper and Slime-army combat.
- Scaling end-game objectives.
- Level 5 professions provide simple early-game buffs that benefit most styles of general gameplay.
- Level 10 professions are more specialized and engaging, providing two bonuses which change the way you play.
- Professions are more consistent across the board, with several analogous perks and synergies.
- Lightweight. This mod is built with a dynamic event handling system to avoid overhead.
- New icons for most professions, courtesy of [IllogicalMoodSwing](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/38784845-illogicalmoodswing/) (please make sure to [endorse their original](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4163)﻿ mod).
