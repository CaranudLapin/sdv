There are tales spoken in the Adventurer's Guild of a once mutated breed of human monster slayers, who used their knowledge of alchemy to develop powerful magical mixtures which gave them superhuman abilities.


Mixtures & Primary Substances

An item may be used as an alchemy ingredient if it contains one of six primary substances:

 Aether (Ae)
 Hydragenum (Hg)
 Quebrith (Qb)
 Rebis (Rb)
 Vermilion (Vm)
 Vitriol (Vt)

These substances can be found in varying concentrations across different items, from foragable goods and flowers, to minerals and even monster parts. When combined in a medium, referred to as a base, these ingredients react to produce different types of mixtures.

There are three mixture types, determined by the base:
Potions are mixed using various distilled alcohols. These are dangerously toxic substances, but grant powerful magical effects to the imbuer.
Weapon oils are mixed using greases, such as oils and butters. They can be applied to weapons to exploit vulnerabilities in each monster's physiology.
Bombs are made from powdered coal. Inspired by the explosives employed by miners, these bombs house violent alchemical reactions that can bring life as well as destruction.

The exact product of a reaction is determined not by the specific ingredients used, but by the proportions of primary substances contained within the chosen ingredients. In other words, there are no set recipes for alchemical mixtures; instead they can be made through any combination of ingredients, so long as the concentrations of each of the primary substances respects a particular formula.


Formulae & Experimentation

Most alchemical formulae can be learned from scrolls found throughout the world. Others are learned by word of mouth. Yet a few can only be learned by experimentation. This method requires manually mixing ingredients in order to create something new. The result will always be an unknown potion, oil or bomb, which must first be tested. If the chosen ingredient combination produced a stable reaction, the formula will be learned, added to your journal, from which point it can be accessed to recreate the mixture just like any ordinarily learned formula. However, if the reaction is unstable then the experiment could prove disastrous!

All formulae can be learned by experimentation, which means that all mixtures are immediately available, limited only by your ingredients and Cauldron.


The Cauldron

The Cauldron is the Alchemist's tool. Forged especially to resist corrosion and trap poisonous fumes, the Cauldron is paramount for safe alchemical practice. In addition, it can be coated with purifying metals such as copper, iron and gold, to reduce the toxicity of resulting mixtures. To begin mixing ingredients you need only approach a heat source, provided by any open flame, with your trusty Cauldron in hand.


Toxicity

Dangerously toxic substances, all potions, as well as some bombs, incur an associated toxicity cost. In order to benefit from their effects, the alchemist must learn to manage the amount of toxins in their body so as to prevent an overdose. Managing toxicity will require careful attention to the toxicity bar, indicated by a skull icon, next to health and energy. This bar represents your toxicity tolerance, and it fills green with each potion imbued or when exposed to the toxins released by certain bombs. Toxicity cost is split between active toxicity, represented in bright green, and dormant toxicity, represented in dark green.

For potions, 75% of the associated toxicity cost is added as active toxicity, which lasts for twice the potion's duration, while the remaining 25% is added as dormant toxicity, and can easily remain in your system for several days. As many potions can be simultaneously imbued as allowed by your toxicity tolerance. However, each active potion effect will increase the toxicity cost of the next, exacerbating the danger of imbuing multiple potions.

For bombs, 100% of the associated toxicity cost is added as dormant toxicity, but only if you are hit by the explosion. Certain bombs with lingering effects will also gradually build active toxicity as you stand in the afflicted area.
 
Excessive toxicity adversely affects your abilities, and may even lead to your demise. Past a certain threshold, you will begin to overdose and lose health over time. Above this threshold, you also become increasingly prone to episodes of toxic fever, which impairs movement at a regular pace. If toxicity ever reaches 100% you will pass out on the spot, ending up in a coma that may last for several days.

Toxicity gradually recovers over time, or can otherwise be purged with white honey. Your toxicity tolerance will naturally build with exposure to the toxins, along with your Alchemy proficiency.


Secondary Substances

There are three additional, or secondary, substances:  Albedo,  Nigredo and  Rubedo﻿. A given ingredient may contain exactly one of these substances, or it may contain none. If all ingredients selected to create a potion (and only a potion) contain the same secondary substance, the resulting potion will provide an additional benefit:
 Albedo — a potion with albedo dominance reduces its own toxicity and that of all subsequent potions consumed during the next in-game hour by 20%.
 Nigredo — a potion with nigredo dominance increases all damage inflicted for the next 4 in-game hours by 20%.
 Rubedo — a potion with rubedo dominance recovers 0.3% max health and energy every second for the next 4 in-game hours.


Skill Perks

Given its place as a widely misunderstood and forgotten science, Alchemy, unlike other crafts, does not allow specialization by branching profession trees. Instead, progression in the Alchemy skill is offered through a much more flexible tree composed of 16 perks split across 4 schools of alchemy craft, each with 4-tiered perks. Upon leveling your Alchemy proficiency you are awarded one perk point to spend on this tree. Higher-tiered perks require at least one perk to be unlocked from the previous tier, but are not otherwise limited to perks in the same school; perks pertaining to different schools are free to be mixed and matched.
