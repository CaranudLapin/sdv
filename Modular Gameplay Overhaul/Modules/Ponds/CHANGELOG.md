# Ponds Module Change Log

## 1.0.0

### Added

* The [Aquarist](../Professions) profession now adds a chance to boost the quality of newborn fishlings, so you may eventually breed high-quality fish from low-quality ones.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug where the counter for spawning Algae in an empty Fish Pond would reset when reloading the save.
* Fixed a typo preventing TFO integration from applying, which in turn caused a conflict with it installed.
