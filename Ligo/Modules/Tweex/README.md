## Features

This module is a collection of small tweaks and fixes to several vanilla inconsistencies or balancing issues not large enough to merit a separate module.

Included tweaks:
- Makes Bee House, Mushroom Box and Tapper produce improve quality with age and skill level, as do vanilla Fruit Trees.
- Makes Mushroom Box, Tappers and Berry Bushes reward foraging experience when harvested.
- Makes large Eggs and Milk double the output stack instead of increasing its quality to gold.
- Prevents Fruit Trees from growing in winter unless fertilized.
- ~~Makes Meads take after the flower type of the input Honey item.~~ This feature has been removed since I learned about [Flower Meads](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5767). Please use that mod instead.
- Causes bombs to explode immediately when hit by other explosions.

All features can be toggled on or off.

## Compatibility

- [Forage Fantasy](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7554) has several conflicting features, but can be used together with this module if you pay attention to the configs of both mods.

## Uninstallation

Safe to uninstall or disable without special measures.
