# Ligo Rings Change Log

## 1.0.0 (Unreleased)

### Added

* Added the Infinity Band. The Iridium Band must now be converted to Infinity before accepting gemstones.
* Added compatibility with [Wear More Rings](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3214).
* Weapon and Slingshots can now resonate with Infinity Bands if Arsenal module is enabled.

### Change

* Complete overhaul of the Resonance feature inspired by real Music Theory. This is now a major gameplay mechanic instead of a small flavor feature. This will hopefully add versatility to the new Infinity Band and encourage variability.
