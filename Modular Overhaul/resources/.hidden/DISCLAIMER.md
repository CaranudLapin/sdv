This assortment of weapon textures is what I personally use.
It combines pieces and textures from Vanilla Tweaks (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10852), Simple Weapons (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16491) and Faithful Weapons (www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12004)
Credit to those goes respectively to Taiyokun, dendenhsmy and herbivoor.
As I do not have permission to redistribute their textures, I am keeping them "hidden" in this folder where I can continue to enjoy the convenience and hopefully dodge plagiarism complaints.

If you find these textures and choose to use them, tell no one.
And also, please drop an endorsement to all mods above.
