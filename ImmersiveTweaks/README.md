## Features

This mod is an amalgamation of small inconsistencies fixes and balancing changes desperately needed by the vanilla game.
 
Major features:
- Rebalances nearly all vanilla weapons and shoes, giving them more distinction and viability.
- Changes the conditions for obtaining the Galaxy Sword, adding a 10 iridum bar requirement which forces the player to venture into the Skull Caverns before obtaining it.
- Changes the treasure rewards for the standard mines to suit the rebalance.
- Changes the effects of Topaz ring to be analogous with Topaz enchantment.
- Rebalances Jade and Topaz enchantments, as well as Jade and Topaz rings, and finally the Crabshell ring.
- Overhauls the Iridium Band, allowing it to combine up to four gemstone rings.

Minor features:
- Makes Mushroom Boxes produce quality mushrooms.
- Makes Bee House and Tapper produce improve quality with age, following the example of Fruit Trees.
- Makes Tappers and Berry Bushes reward Foraging experience when harvested.
- Makes Meads take after the flower type of the input Honey item (with support for Better Artisan Good Icons).
- Fruit Trees don't grow in winter.

- Removes the "grace period" of Slingshot projectiles, allowing enemies to be hit immediately near the player.
- Removes the 50% soft cap to damage mitigation from the player's defense stat.
- Improves the effects of Jade and Topaz enchantments to be more viable alternatives.
- Similarly improves the effects of Jade and Topaz rings to be more viable alternatives, as well as the Crabshell Ring for consistency.
- Changes the crafting recipe of the Glowstone Ring to require one Magnet Ring and one Glow Ring.
- Adds Sunburst enchant to the game.

## Compatibility

This mod makes heavy use of Harmony to patch the behavior of Fish Ponds and adjacent objects. Any SMAPI mods that also patch Fish Pond behavior might be incompatible. Content Patcher packs that edit Fish Ponds or FishPondData are compatible, however.

- Compatible with (and meant to be paired with) [Walk Of Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8111).
- Compatible with [Pond Painter](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4703).
- **Not** compatible with [Anything Pond](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4702) or [Quality Fish Ponds](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11021).

Should be fully compatible with multiplayer.

## Installation

Install like any other mod, by extracting the content of the downloaded zip file to your mods folder and starting the game via SMAPI.

To update, first delete the old version and then install the new one. You can optionally keep your configs.json in case you have personalized settings.

To uninstall simply delete the mod from your mods folder. This mod is safe to uninstall at any point.
