## 0.9.0 (Initial release)

### Added

* When a Gemologist reaches a new quality threshold, all currently processing Crystalariums owned by that player will likewise receive a quality upgrade to reflect that.
* Scavenger profession now has a chance, proportional to the Treasure Hunt Streak, to spawn additional forage when entering a new map.
* Prospector profession, likewise, now has a chance, proportional to the Treasure Hunt Streak, to spawn additional ore nodes when entering a new mine level.
* Added golden versions of profession icons for Prestiged professions.

* Added API for custom Skill mods to register prestiged professions.

### Removed

* Removed the SeaweedIsTrash config setting.
* Removed configs from the [IProfessions interface](../../../Shared/Integrations/ModularOverhaul/IModularOverhaul.cs).

### Changed

* **Rascal** - ~~Slingshot damage +25%. 60% chance to recover spent ammo.~~ Gain one additional ammo slot. 35% chance to recover spent ammo.
    * The damage perk is gone. I always felt like Slingshot damage was overpowered anyway. In its place comes a second ammo slot; Rascals can now equip 2 different types of ammo (or the same ammo twice). Use the Mod Key (default LeftShift) to toggle between equipped ammos.
    * The ammo recovery perk has been nerfed to account for new enchantments provided by the [Slingshots](../Arsenal) module. In exchange, the Prestige perk now doubles this value to a whopping 70%---a higher value than the original.
    * Ability to equip Slime ammo moved from Slimed Piper to Rascal. It will still cause a slow debuff, but will not heal ally Slimes unless the player *also* has the Piper profession.
* **Slimed Piper** - Summoned Slimes are now friendly (will not attack players, but will still cause damage if touched).
* **Desperado (Prestiged)** - ~~Overcharged shots become spreadshots.~~ Overcharged shots can pierce enemies.
    * The Spreadshot perk has been moved to a new enchantments provided by the [Slingshots](../Arsenal) module. The ability to pierce enemies with overcharged shots is now the new prestige perk.
* The [API](../../../Shared/Integrations/ModularOverhaul/IModularOverhaulApi.cs) has been slightly changed. Some mods may need to update the corresponding interfaces.

### Fixed

* Fixed an issue with Automated Junimo Chests being unable to decide their owner.
* Fixed a bug where Conservationist Trash Collected would not reset if no trash was collected during the season.
* Fixed a bug where Tapper perk would incorrectly apply to tapped Mushroom Trees in Winter, causing multiple progressively shortened harvests.
* Fixed a bug where the Piper Concerto super ability caused all Slimes in the Hutch to disappear.
* Crab Pots now correctly trap Seaweed instead of Green Algae in the Beach farm map.
* Fixed a bug where Special Abiltiy charge would still accumulate with Enable Specials config set to false.
* Fixed a possible NullReferenceException when shooting at Slimes.
* Fixed TrackerPointerScale and TrackerPointerBobbingRate config settings.
